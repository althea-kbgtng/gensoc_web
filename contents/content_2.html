        <h1>Is Gender Really All in Our Heads?</h1>
    </header>
    <main class="article-content">
        <p>Ever stopped to think about why we dress little girls in pink and boys in blue? Or why certain jobs are still seen as only "men" can do while others are "for women"? It turns out, a lot of what we consider simply "male" or "female" isn't birthed by biology at all. Welcome to the fascinating world of gender as a social construction.</p>

        <p>Forget the old idea that gender is just about what body parts you have. Our culture, history, and even our language play a massive role in shaping what we understand gender to be. It's like we've collectively agreed on a set of rules and meanings, then applied them to people based on certain physical traits. And guess what? These rules aren't static; they shift and change across different times and places!</p>

        <h2>So, What Does "Social Construction" Actually Mean?</h2>
        <p>Social constructionism suggests that our categories for people – like "man" or "woman" – are similarly built, not just discovered. While bodies certainly vary, our societies pick out specific features, assign deep meanings to them, and then use those meanings to categorize us. Think about it: a dress isn't inherently "feminine," nor are short haircuts inherently "masculine," but our culture has often assigned these meanings.</p>

        <p>This isn't about denying biological differences, but rather exploring how our societies take those differences and stack them on a whole system of expectations, roles, and even power dynamics. When we talk about gender being socially constructed, we're asking: Who decided what's "masculine" or "feminine"?</p>

        <p>Understanding gender as a social construct opens up huge conversations about equality, freedom, and the endless possibilities for how we can define ourselves beyond outdated boxes. It challenges us to look deeper than surface-level assumptions and recognize the incredible influence culture has on who we are and who we're expected to be.</p>
